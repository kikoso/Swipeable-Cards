Swipeable cards: Tinder-like cards library for Android
=================

Swipeable-cards is a native library for Android that provide a Tinder card like effect. A card can be constructed using an image and displayed with animation effects, dismiss-to-like and dismiss-to-unlike, and use different sorting mechanisms.

The library is compatible for Android versions 3.0 (API Level 11) and upwards.

A [library][1] and a [sample application][2] are provided with the code.

Usage
--------------------
Download the library with git and import it into your project (right now there is only Gradle support, so you need to import it writing in your build.gradle the following:

     compile project(':AndTinder')

and in your settings.gradle

    include 'AndTinder'
    
You can also download it via MavenCentral and Gradle:

    dependencies {
        ompile 'com.github.kikoso:SwipeableCards:1.0-RELEASE@aar'
    }

When you have included the library in your project, you need to proceeed as follows. First, create a container to store the cards.

    <com.andtinder.view.CardContainer xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
        android:id="@+id/layoutview"
        android:layout_width="fill_parent"
        android:layout_height="fill_parent" />
    
From your Activity, inflate into a CardContainer the container you declared in your XML
    
    mCardContainer = (CardContainer) findViewById(R.id.layoutview);

The card container can sort the cards either ordered or disordered:

     mCardContainer.setOrientation(Orientation.Ordered);
     mCardContainer.setOrientation(Orientation.Disordered);
     
Now you need to create your cards. The procedure is quite simple: you just need to create an object CardView and provide the image resource you want to add:

    CardModel card = new CardModel("Title1", "Description goes here", r.getDrawable(R.drawable.picture1);
    
Additionally, you can set up a listener to be notified when the image is being liked or disliked:
     
     card.setOnCardDismissedListener(new CardModel.OnCardDismissedListener() {
            @Override
            public void onLike(CardView cardView) {
                Log.d("Swipeable Card", "I liked it");
            }

            @Override
            public void onDislike(CardView cardView) {
                Log.d("Swipeable Card", "I did not liked it");
            }
        });

Or when it is clicked:

       card.setOnClickListener(new CardModel.OnClickListener() {
           @Override
           public void OnClickListener() {
               Log.i("Swipeable Cards","I am pressing the card");
           }
        });
        
Finally, use an adapter to link the cards and the container:

     SimpleCardStackAdapter adapter = new SimpleCardStackAdapter(this);
     adapter.add(new CardModel("Title1", "Description goes here", r.getDrawable(R.drawable.picture1)));
     mCardContainer.setAdapter(adapter);
   

Version history
--------------------
*  4.06.2014: Published the version 0.2 with several improvements thanks to [Dr-Emann][5]

Next steps
--------------------
There are many things that can be done with this library. 

* Allow custom templates
* Extend image personalization options
* Recreate the container when it has been emptied

If you want to colaborate with the project or have any idea to be implemented feel free to submit a pull request or to write an issue!
